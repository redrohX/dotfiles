# Niels' dotfiles

I blatantly stole this from [Paul Irish](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles/). It's just a place where I store my own dotfiles. 

The thing I hate most is starting out from scratch on a new machine. This will help me get up to speed and import all my favorite dotfiles. 

This repo is mostly for me but you're welcome to make suggestions. I'm not an expert at all on this matter and I'm mostly catching up.
